# Query

## 1. What is “Query”?

Query is a tool for querying stock indicator data. It has many query parameters that allow users to choose suitable parameters according to their needs, such as market value and P/E ratio of a certain stock, as well as technical indicators like SMA and EMA.

In addition, Query also supports saving query conditions for future use and sharing queries with friends.

## 2. How to use “Query”?

Open the [BreadthApp Query](https://breadth.app/query) page, and you will see a Query page as shown in the following figure:

### 2.2 Advanced search

Advanced search supports two operations: `Filter` and `Sort`. The condition panel can be called out by clicking on the `Add Filter` button.

- **Filter**: Search conditions, which can filter stocks based on market value, P/E ratio, technical indicators, etc.
- **Sort**: Sorted in descending order by default. It can be sorted based on a certain indicator, such as sorting by market value from largest to smallest.

>Click ‘Add Filter’ to show the filter panel.
